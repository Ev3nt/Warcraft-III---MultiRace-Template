# Warcraft III - MultiRace Template (1.26)


This code makes it possible to change the number of races, both add new ones and remove existing ones. The code is written in C ++ and ASM (MASM). This code was written specifically for MM Engine. Nirvana and her crutches motivated me to write this code :)
